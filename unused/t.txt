This research provides a Recursive Trust Labeling approach for identifying fraudulent medical websites. 
Recursive trust labeling (RTL) is an adaptive learning technique that improves the identification of fraudulent medical websites 
by combining a recursive labeling mechanism with graph-based classifiers and underlying content. 
To train and assess their RTL system, 1,000 phony and 1,000 genuine medical websites made up the dataset. 
Two steps were taken in the training of the RTL algorithm. First, based on the textual content of the websites, 
a content classifier was trained to detect phony medical websites. Using the link structure as a guide, 
a graph-based classifier was trained to detect phony medical websites in the second step.
A graph-based classifier and a content classifier are the two primary parts of the RTL algorithm. 
A supervised learning model called the content classifier makes use of several features that are taken 
from a website's textual content to determine if the website is authentic or fraudulent. The graph-based 
The classifier is an unsupervised learning algorithm that predicts whether a website is authentic or fraudulent based on its contact structure.
Recursively classifying webpages according to their content and link structure is how the RTL algorithm 
operates. Initially, a limited group of seed websites are classified as either authentic or fraudulent by
the algorithm. Subsequently, it labels its neighbors based on the content and link structure of the seed websites.
Until all of the websites in the dataset have been tagged, the algorithm keeps labeling websites recursively. 
On the test dataset consisting of phony and authentic medical websites, the RTL algorithm attained a 94% accuracy rate [22].
